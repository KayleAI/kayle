Over the past few weeks, we’ve been working on several important updates to Kayle.

### Functionality updates

- Multiple bug fixes and stability improvements.
- Added the ability to moderate text and audio content via the API.

### New UI & Icons

We’ve completely revamped the look and feel of Kayle, and thanks to [Nucleo](nucleoapp.com), we’ve got some nice new icons!

We’ll continue to improve the API endpoints and add new features over the coming weeks, including:

- Support for image and video moderation.
- Easily determine whether to allow or block content based on your own moderation policies.
- Improved documentation and examples.
