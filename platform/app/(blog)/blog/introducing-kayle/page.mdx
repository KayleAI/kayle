Kayle started as a school project back in February of 2023; since then, we’ve experimented with different approaches to content moderation, 
we’ve spoken to stakeholders of all sizes and iterated to reach the degree of understanding that a content moderation platform needs to have.

## Our mission

When we were children, the Internet exposed us to material that is still too difficult to describe and that we should never have seen.

As time goes on, we continue to observe some of the ***worst in humanity***—things that no one should have to see.

**This must stop.**

So we’re building Kayle to prevent harmful content from being easily accessible and to protect everyone, **especially children**.

## What we’ve learnt

In the past year and a half, we’ve learned that several factors can make or break a content moderation service.

### Pricing

The biggest factor is **cost**.

From speaking with those who need moderation, we continue to see that the most significant reason they opt out of using **any** form of moderation is the cost of implementing it.

**A good content moderation service is <ins>cheap</ins>—even at much higher usage levels.**

### User experience

A commonly overlooked factor is **user experience**, which refers to several different types of users.
1. A platform’s users
2. The moderators
3. The business leaders

Here’s why:
1. A platform’s users don’t want poor moderation to affect them, whether reports go unaddressed or their content is inaccurately removed.
2. The moderators want an easy-to-use platform to manage reports, moderate content, or suspend users—they **need** the platform to be clear from day one, not after weeks of use.
3. The business leaders need a service that can give them peace of mind, *knowing their platform is safe*.

**A successful content moderation platform must consider all of these users.**

### Developer experience

Another commonly overlooked factor is **developer experience**.

Excellent developer experience (DX) is crucial for any software-based company, and a content moderation platform is no exception.

**It’s the developers who build platforms, not the content moderators.**

## What we’re doing

We’re building Kayle to be the **greatest** content moderation platform in the world.

And we’re building Kayle in public with our entire codebase open-source for several reasons:
- **Anyone** should be able to contribute to Kayle.
- **Everyone** needing content moderation should be able to access the service without using our cloud platform (i.e., **anyone** should be able to **self-host** Kayle).

## Our plans

Over the coming months, we’ll be rolling out the necessities (and more) for a content moderation platform.

So far, we’ve released the Moderation API for text, audio, and images, with video, document, and URL moderation coming soon.

We’ll be **upgrading** our dashboard for moderators to have a better experience when moderating content, and we’ll be adding more things to the dashboard such as:
- Reports
- Analytics
- User management

Further down the line, we’ll be introducing some more useful tools:
- **Kayle Predator**—a tool to catch child predators **before** they hurt any child.
- **Kayle Shield**—a tool to identify individuals vulnerable to **radicalisation** and support them before they cause harm.
- **Kayle Hunter**—a tool that allows the **community** to find and report unflagged content.
- **Kayle Apps**—multiple apps for various services such as **Discord** and **Reddit** that help automatically moderate communities.

We’ll soon start onboarding beta testers from [our waitlist](https://go.kayle.ai/waitlist)—join if you haven’t already!
