# Webhooks

In this guide, we will look at how to register and consume webhooks to integrate your app with Kayle. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Warn>
  Webhooks are not generally available yet.
</Warn>

<hr />

## Registering a webhook

To register a webhook, head over to the [developer settings](https://kayle.ai/developers) and click on the "Webhooks" tab. 
Here, you can register a webhook by providing the URL that Kayle should send the webhook to and the events that should trigger the webhook.
You'll receive a secret key when you register a webhook, which you can use to verify the authenticity of the webhook.

## Consuming a webhook

<Note>
  While we work on getting webhooks ready, we've not yet enabled the webhook functionality.

## Security

To know for sure that a webhook was, in fact, sent by Kayle instead of a malicious actor, you can verify the request signature. 
Each webhook request contains a header named `x-kayle-signature`, and you can verify this signature by using your secret webhook key. 
The signature is an HMAC hash of the request payload hashed using your secret key. 
Here is an example of how to verify the signature in your app:

<CodeGroup title="Verifying a request">

```js
const signature = req.headers['x-kayle-signature']
const hash = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret).update(payload).digest('hex')

if (hash === signature) {
  // Request is verified
} else {
  // Request could not be verified
}
```

```python
from flask import request
import hashlib
import hmac

signature = request.headers.get("x-kayle-signature")
hash = hmac.new(bytes(secret, "ascii"), bytes(payload, "ascii"), hashlib.sha256)

if hash.hexdigest() == signature:
    # Request is verified
else:
    # Request could not be verified
```

```php
$signature = $request['headers']['x-kayle-signature'];
$hash = hash_hmac('sha256', $payload, $secret);

if (hash_equals($hash, $signature)) {
  // Request is verified
} else {
  // Request could not be verified
}
```

</CodeGroup>

If your generated signature matches the `x-kayle-signature` header, you can be sure that the request was truly coming from Kayle. It's essential to keep your secret webhook key safeâ€”otherwise, you can no longer be sure that a given webhook was sent by Kayle. Don't commit your secret webhook key to GitHub!
