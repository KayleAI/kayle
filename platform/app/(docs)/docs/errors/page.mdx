# Errors

In this guide, we will talk about what happens when something goes wrong while you work with the API. Let's look at some status codes and error types you might encounter. {{ className: 'lead' }}

You can tell if your request was successful by checking the status code when receiving an API response. If a response comes back unsuccessful, you can use the error message, hint, and documentation URL to figure out what has gone wrong and do some rudimentary debugging (before [contacting support](/help)).
## Status codes

Here is a list of the different categories of status codes returned by the Kayle API. Use these to understand if a request was successful.

<Properties>
  <Property name="2xx">
    A 2xx status code indicates a successful response.
  </Property>
  <Property name="4xx">
    A 4xx status code indicates a client error—this is a _you_ problem.
  </Property>
  <Property name="5xx">
    A 5xx status code indicates a server error—this is a problem with us.
  </Property>
</Properties>
