# Authentication

You'll need to authenticate your requests to access any of the endpoints in the Kayle API. In this guide, we'll look at how authentication works. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Using API keys

To authenticate your requests, you need to include an API key in the header of your request.

<Note>
  You can find your API keys in [Developer Portal &raquo; API Keys](/developers/keys).
</Note>

```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
curl -X POST https://api.kayle.ai/v1/moderate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "I am a good person", "type": "text"}'
```

## Using an SDK

<Warn>
  SDKs are not yet available—documentation for authenticating with SDKs will be available when SDKs are ready.
