# Quickstart

This guide will get you all set up and ready to use the Kayle API. We'll cover how to get started using one of our API clients and how to make your first API request. We'll also look at where to go next to find all the information you need to take full advantage of our powerful REST API. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>
  Before you can make requests to the Kayle API, you will need to grab your
  API key from your dashboard. You can find it in [Developer Portal &raquo; API Keys](https://kayle.ai/developers/keys).
</Note>

## Choose your client

Before making your first API request, you need to pick which API client you will use. In addition to good ol' cURL HTTP requests, Kayle offers clients for JavaScript, Python, and PHP. In the following example, you can see how to install each client.

<CodeGroup>

```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
# cURL is most likely already installed on your machine
curl --version
```

```bash {{ language: 'js' }}
# Install the Kayle JavaScript SDK
npm install @kayle/kayle-js --save
```

```bash {{ language: 'python' }}
# Install the Kayle Python SDK
pip install kayle_api
```

```bash {{ language: 'php' }}
# Install the Kayle PHP SDK
composer require kayle/sdk
```

</CodeGroup>

<div className="not-prose">
  <Button href="/sdks" variant="text" arrow="right">
    <>Check out our list of first-party SDKs</>
  </Button>
</div>

## Making your first API request

After picking your preferred client, you are ready to make your first call to the Kayle API.

<CodeGroup tag="POST" label="/v1/moderate">

```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
curl -X POST https://api.kayle.ai/v1/moderate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "I am a good person", "type": "text"}'
```

```js
// coming soon!
```

```python
# coming soon!
```

```php
// coming soon!
```

</CodeGroup>

<div className="not-prose">
  <Button href="/docs/moderate/text" variant="text" arrow="right">
    <>Read the moderation docs</>
  </Button>
</div>
