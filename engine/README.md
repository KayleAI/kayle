# Kayle Engine

This is the engine (or API) for Kayle.

## Development

We recommend using [Bun](https://bun.sh/) when developing locally.

```bash
bun i
bun dev
```

## Deployment

```bash
bun run deploy
```

## Useful information

Whenever a warning or error should be logged, include the `Warning:` or `Error:`
prefix since this will be displayed in [Baselime](https://baselime.io/).
